## Acknowledgement
In completion of this project, I used my Friend's business Silindile Nkosi to build this e-commerce website because I want to build more projects for myself and keep learning new languages. Silindile Nkosi has a small business called Adorn Products that sells nails, jewelry, hair and provide services to her customers by doing their nails. I would like to acknowledge her for allowing me to use her business. 

## Background
E-commerce website is very important in today's world where customers can purchase products in their comforts homes and it can get delivered to their door steps. E-commerce has increased business revenues over the past few years here in South Africa. 


## Problem Statement 
When I did a research on Silindile Nkosi's business I found out that her business doesn't have a ecommerce website where her customers can purchase products online. 

## Solution Statement 
It's very important when a person has a business to have e-commerce website so that customers can purchase products wherever they are in the country.
