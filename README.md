## Acknowledgement
In completion of this project, I used my Friend's business Silindile Nkosi to build this e-commerce website because I want to build more projects for myself and keep learning new languages. Silindile Nkosi has a small business called Adorn Products that sells nails, jewelry, hair and provide services to her customers by doing their nails. I would like to acknowledge her for allowing me to use her business. 

## Background
E-commerce website is very important in today's world where customers can purchase products in their comforts homes and it can get delivered to their door steps. E-commerce has increased business revenues over the past few years here in South Africa. 


## Problem Statement 
When I did a research on Silindile Nkosi's business I found out that her business doesn't have a ecommerce website where her customers can purchase products online. 

## Solution Statement 
It's very important when a person has a business to have e-commerce website so that customers can purchase products wherever they are in the country.

## Challenges
I faced two challenges when I was developing this website.
1. The first challenge is that, I struggled to import ReactJS files to Github, I watched many tutorials on how to tackle this challenge but couldn't get any help that is why it's only showing one langauge which is HTML.
2. The second challenge is that, when a user opens the website, it doesn't land on a home page, I don't know how that happened but I'm working fixing it.
## Some noticable improvements that could be made
1. The website need to land on a home page.
2. Signup page must be functioning
3. About me, icon links need to function
4. Might add AI Chatbot that will assist customers when browsing through the website.
